Instructions

(This does not work with the Excel setup sheet and tool list)
About the script
What does this file do?

Once you define your new column names, X+ will use those names whenever you create a setup sheet or tool list.
What doesn't this file do?

This file does not add any extra functionality to X+ Setup Sheet and Tool List. It simply changes the name that appears at the top of each column.
How to use it

1) Unzip and place this file in the .../public/documents/X+ folder with the rest of the X+ files. You may have to rename this file, but we'll get to that in a few minutes.
Rename the .js file to match your configuration name.

2) Maybe you have a different configuration file for each machine? No problem! For each of your different configuration files, name a copy of the .js file by the same name. Your configuration file names can be found here.
